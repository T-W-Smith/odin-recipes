        <h3>Mouth watering pizza filled with different breakfast foods</h3>
        <p>
            This pizza is just the perfect all-round breakfast meal. It has a little bit of everything that mesh very well together.

            The crescent-roll crust gives a nice crispy and flakey taste. Adding in the bacon, hash browns, and cheese gives that extra tasty punch.

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of bacon bits</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheese</li>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Directions</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Separate crescent-roll dough into triangles and place in a rimmed 12-inch pizza pan, points toward the inside. Press the triangles together to join; pinch dough so it comes 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Spoon bacon bits over crust. Spread hash browns over sausage and sprinkle with Cheddar. Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until smooth and pour egg mixture over cheese. Sprinkle pizza evenly with Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set and crust is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
