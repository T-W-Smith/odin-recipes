        <h3>A tasty waffle perfect for the morning</h3>
        <p>
            In my opinion, what makes this waffle recipe the best is the batter. It is quick and easy to prepare and you can mix it all up with a simple fork.

            These waffles are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Also, what sets the taste through the roof in the hint of butter and vanilla throughout.
